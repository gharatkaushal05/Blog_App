Blog Management System

This project is a comprehensive blog management system built with Express.js and MongoDB. It allows users to create and manage blog posts, interact with content through comments, and engage with posts by liking or unliking them.

Key Features:
Blog Creation: Users can create new blog posts with rich content, including titles, body text, and tags. Posts are stored in a MongoDB database for efficient management and retrieval.
Comments: Each blog post supports user comments, enabling readers to leave feedback and interact with the content. Comments are stored and associated with the respective posts.
Like/Unlike: Users can like or unlike blog posts to show their appreciation or disapproval. This feature helps gauge the popularity and engagement of each post.
User Authentication: Implement user authentication to manage who can create posts and comments, and ensure that likes and comments are properly attributed.
RESTful API: The project includes a RESTful API built with Express.js for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting blog posts, comments, and likes.
Technologies Used:
Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that handles routing, middleware, and server-side logic.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing blog posts, comments, and user data in a scalable and flexible manner.
Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a straightforward way to model and manage application data.
